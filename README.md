# Machine_learning_text_generator

The program that you will write is based on a machine-learning algorithm. Using statistical techniques known as Markov Processes and Monte Carlo methods, the program “learns” the style of the text that you feed it (assuming that the text is sufficiently long). The program then proceeds to happily generate nonsense texts written in the same style, and in any desirable length.


I made this fun project as part of my CS degree in IDC in the "introduction to programming course" as a final project. 

The documentation of the homework and the assignments are in the folder description - you are welcome to look at that and try to make it yourself. 


enjoy.
